These tests are divided into two categories. Each category requires a
different driver. Both drivers are written in Python for the sake of
convince. Both categories test for both correct functionality as well as
proper handling of errors.

Unit testing requires the actual source code to test. Broadly, the tests
are organized by file name. Each test is a stand-alone executable that
outputs information on stdout. That information is captured and compared
to known good output.

Functional tests are ones that actually use the generated executable to
compile and run actual clock code. These tests are organized by catagories
that come from testing areas of the actual syntax of a complete program.
